This is a simple app to log where things happen, how often, and when, when running an app with `{golem}`.
 
Every piece of the app has a `cli::cat_rule()` that prints to the console the place where it is. 

The idea here is to be able to use these simple logs to know how often specific pieces of the apps are called inside your infra.
